## ScienceFair
21st century scientific and scholarly publishing is a rapidly changing landscape. Modern research is fast-paced and increasingly collaborative. However, scholarly publication remains the main output of modern science and research. Publications are static, most are not packaged with underlying datasets, access to published work is often restricted, and open versions of papers may be hard to find. These aspects of traditional publishing create unnecessary challenges for researchers who want their work to be reproducible and widely read. 

Our vision is to create a unified platform to bring together the entire process of scientific publishing. We believe that an authoring environment with integrations to support reproducible analysis and publication creation combined with a reading, annotation, and citation tool that enables community sharing and will revolutionise the way researchers interact with the scientific literature. 

Science moves fast. At ScienceFair, we believe published information should be: 
- Easy to access and navigate publications
- Easy to annotate, organize into collections, and share with colleagues and curate as a community
- Easy to author, cite, and sumbit publications
- Free of information-lag, highlighting publication updates and retractions
- Supporting reproducible research standards with rich metadata
- Dynamic, interactive, and editable

### The Vision

### Paper reading environment

Our reading environment gives context-rich access to published work. Beyond reading the paper, researchers can browse figures, explore other references, and access metadata about papers (such as e.g. redaction information) all within the same interactive window. The papers are searchable, annotations can be added, and the papers (along with annotation) can be shared with colleagues.

### Paper authoring environment

ScienceFair will enable author papers smoothly via integrations with existing open source authoring tools and intuitively submit to a range of journals within the same editing environment. 

Our paper authoring environment will include: 
- A single interface that pre-loads different journal requirements
- Dynamic fetching of references and context around existing literature
- Built-in tools for doing reproducible science, eg: embedded code for figures and plots.

### Vision 2018 - 2019
Supported by eLife Innovation and the Coko Foundation, we have developed a functioning prototype. Over the next 24 months, we plan to build out this prototype with features and integrations with publishers and open source tools (Stencila, Dat, Juypter, RStudio). The ScienceFair prototype has created a buzz in the community and drawn early users. From here, we will leverage this excitement and community support to build a tool that addresses researcher pain points. Areas of focus:

#### Authoring and collaboration
- We want to enable users manage their libraries, author manuscripts, manage citations, as well as work on papers together. 
#### Sharing and annotation tools
We want to enable users to share and comment on scientific literature, create and update collections,  and share live-updating annotated collections with colleagues.
#### Dynamic literature
We want to make it possible to edit and comment on papers continually, with built-in version control. Science and peer review should not stop at the publication step. 
#### User-created app marketplace
We want to create an app marketplace to enable our community of users to share scientific knowledge discovery tools that they have built themselves in order to enhance their ScienceFair experience. 

### The timeline
We have developed a basic prototype of the paper browsing system. The proposed work would take place over the next 24 months with the following work packages: 

Stage 1: enhancing reading environment (8 months)

Stage 2: creating a prototype of the authoring environment (8 months)

Stage 3: setting up key partnerships and technical integration work (8 months)

Ongoing: Community feedback, iterative development, and outreach
